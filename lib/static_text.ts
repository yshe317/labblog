export const LABINTRO = "SymbioticLab focuses on large-scale data systems that can yield order-of-magnitude performance and efficiency improvements. We tailor existing Big Data and AI/ML applications and design new ones to best leverage their underlying infrastructure. This boils down to three operating regimes: single-microsecond latency within a rack, single-millisecond latency within a datacenter, and hundreds-of-milliseconds latency across the world."
